# My Portfolio Site <!-- omit in toc -->

## Introduction

This is a personal website for my portfolio. It was made to both show off a more curated list of my open and closed source projects, as well as to experiment with [Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [3D elements](https://github.com/grischaerbe/threlte)

## Forking

I have tried to make it possible to use this site for yourself quite easily by editing the files within: `src/config`. You can drop any 3d models into `static/models`. The backbone of interest tracking is built on top of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and, as of right now, requires you to enable the Blaze plan.
